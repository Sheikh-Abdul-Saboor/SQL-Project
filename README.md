I developed a Database Management System Project that allows users to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve records through a structured and user-friendly design. The project focuses on applying database concepts like tables, queries, and relationships to handle data in an organized way. Users can add new records, update or delete existing entries, and search for specific data quickly. This project also ensures data integrity and accuracy while making database operations simple and interactive. It helped me strengthen my understanding of SQL, relational database design, and how databases are used in real-world applications for managing large amounts of information.
